# Dev Notes – DocuQuery

### Current Focus

### Remember
- The about and terms and conditions pages are not a finished product yet and will change throughout the entire development phase
- Any time you add a new provider you need to update the account page to include it correctly
- When you add payment, deleting an account will need to be updated accordingly. The user will have to cancel their plan first or you auto-cancel for them.

### Next Steps
1. Implement caching
2. Implement stripe? Add a paid plan?
3. Re-configure rate limits and make it a finished product

### Known Bugs
- None currently
