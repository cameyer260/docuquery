# Dev Notes â€“ DocuQuery

### Current Focus
- configure the signin/signup page
- start using the if user signed in show this else show this logic through all the pages

### Remember
- The about and terms and conditions pages are not a finished product yet and will change throughout the entire development phase

### Next Steps
1. Implement uploading/digesting files with all necessary api routes (chunk pdf file up, then send to pinecone to be embedded and stored)
2. Implement necessary api(s) for /ask:
    - take user input, send it to pinecone for ONLY embedding and query db for similar results from docs that user owns
    - create the prompt following layout in notebook, combine the text of the relevant pdf chunks and the user's text question
    - send prompt to openai api
    - apply rate limits here, update wherever they are stored in (cache, db, etc)
    - return the response back to the user
3. Once you've created a working mvp, deploy to prod-> follow all generic first-time deploy steps on vps, copy .env vars over changing NEXT_AUTH url from local host to correct url, and get google oauth project published and out of "testing" via the cloud oauth api
4. Implement caching
5. Add rate limits (while in development, do not require payment, implement hard limits on both auth and unauthed users)
6. Implement stripe
7. Re-configure rate limits and make it a finished product

### Known Bugs
- None currently
